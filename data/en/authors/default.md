## Hi I'm Aswin Sivasubramaniam

## Why have this blog?

## **Because sharing is learning**

I started this blog as a way to document and share the things I have learned and found useful in my journey as a Digital Marketer.

Writing and noting things down is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and practical usage of AI Tools. I am also sharing my experiences of working with different clients and different projects where i am providing my Digital Marketing Consultation Service.

I hope that my blog can be a helpful resource for others who are interested in Digital Marketing, Branding and Storytelling.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written.
